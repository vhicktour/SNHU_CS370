Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using deep Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique. The agent's goal was to navigate a maze to find treasure before the human player. I was provided with some starter code, including the TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py files, which set up the environment and managed the agent's experience replay. I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm in the provided Jupyter Notebook, specifically completing the code in the qtrain function to train the agent.

Work Completed:

Given Code: I was provided with the code that sets up the maze environment, the experience replay mechanism, and some utility functions. This code helped initialize the environment and manage the agent's interactions with the maze.
Code Created: I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm in the Jupyter Notebook. This involved completing the pseudocode provided in the qtrain function, where I wrote the logic for training the neural network and managing the agent's exploration and exploitation behavior.
Connecting Learning to Computer Science
What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing algorithms, designing software, and creating models that help automate and enhance various tasks. Their work is crucial because it drives innovation across many industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. By developing intelligent systems like the pirate agent, computer scientists can create more interactive and challenging gaming experiences, demonstrating the practical applications of AI in real-world scenarios.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist:
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. This project required me to understand reinforcement learning, neural networks, and the specific problem of pathfinding in a maze. I first reviewed the provided code, identified the key areas where I needed to implement my solution, and then methodically built and tested the deep Q-learning algorithm. This approach ensured that each component worked correctly before moving on to the next.

Ethical Responsibilities:
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the technologies I develop are fair, unbiased, and used responsibly. In the context of this project, this means being aware of how reinforcement learning models might reflect biases in the data they are trained on and ensuring that the agent's behavior is transparent and explainable. Additionally, I must consider the societal impact of AI technologies, ensuring they are used to benefit users and not cause harm.
